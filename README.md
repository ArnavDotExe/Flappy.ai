# Flappy.ai
# Flappy Bird AI with Genetic Algorithm

An implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game featuring both human-playable mode and an AI agent trained using genetic algorithms. The AI learns to navigate through pipes by evolving its neural network weights across generations.

## How the AI Works

### Neural Network Structure
The AI uses a simple neural network with:
- Input Layer: 2 neurons (pipe distance and height difference)
- Output Layer: 1 neuron (jump decision)
- Weights are evolved through genetic algorithm

### Genetic Algorithm Implementation
1. **Initialization**: Creates a population of 100 birds with random neural network weights
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: Birds are evaluated based on:
   - Distance traveled
   - Survival time
   - Pipes passed
3. **Selection**: Top performing birds are selected for breeding
4. **Breeding**: New generation created through:
   - Weight inheritance from best performers
   - Random mutations (10-20% mutation rate)
5. **Iteration**: Process repeats until optimal performance is achieved

## Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted in the code:

```python
BIRD_COUNT = 100        # Number of birds in population
MUTATION_RATE = 0.1     # Base mutation rate
PIPE_DISTANCE = 300     # Initial distance between pipes
BASE_PIPE_SPEED = 2.5   # Initial game speed
```

## Performance

The AI typically shows significant improvement within 10-15 generations and can achieve consistent high scores after 20-30 generations. Performance may vary based on:
- Initial random weights
- Mutation rate
- Population size
- Pipe spacing and speed
